# Rundeck and MySQL Docker environment

This is a Docker Compose example to run Rundeck + MySQL as a backend.

To run, clone the repository and then execute:

`docker compose up`

After a couple of minutes, the Rundeck environment should be available, open your favorite browser (no IE please!) and access to `http://localhost:4440` URL, user: `admin`, password: `admin`.
